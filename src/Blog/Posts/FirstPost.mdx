export let Summary = {
	meta: "Testero 1",
	summary: "This is my first post",
	heading: "How I built this Blog"
}


I built this blog kind of in a strange way. I first wanted it to be hosted on GitHub, but then I discovered that GitHub Pages was not able to work with React Router, but you can use React Static to solve this.

Now I will test out some code.
